# HOTrc to Arduino Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up the HOTrc with Arduino using a **L298N motor driver** and **CT-6A model** with the **F-06A receiver**.

## Steps to Set Up:

### 1. Download Arduino IDE
- Go to the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Download and install the Arduino IDE for your operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux).

### 2. Install L298N Motor Driver Library
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
- Search for **L298N** and install the library.

### 3. Connect the HOTrc CT-6A Model to the F-06A Receiver
- Ensure your **CT-6A transmitter** is paired with the **F-06A receiver**.

### 4. Use 6 Channels for Control
- **CH1** and **CH2** control:
  - **CH1** = Steering
  - **CH2** = Throttle

### 5. Upload Code to Arduino
- Write or load the appropriate code to read signals from the F-06A receiver and control the motors via L298N.
